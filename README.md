2. Now go to your main file in my case it is `index.js`, and on the top of your file paste this code, and it will create an express app.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at Port: ${port}`);
});
```

3. Next Click `Run` button, if already running stop it and `Run` the project, you'll see a browser window appeared in the top right corner.

4. Now copy the url in the browser window.
